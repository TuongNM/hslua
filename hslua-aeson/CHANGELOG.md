# Changelog

`hslua-aeson` uses [PVP Versioning][].

## hslua-aeson-2.3.0

Release pending.

-   The `peekValue` peeker now checks for a `__toaeson` metafield
    or `__tojson` metamethod and uses them to compute the `Value`
    of an object:

    The `__toaeson` metafield, if set, must be a function pushed
    via `pushToAeson`. That function is called on a given object,
    and the returned *Value* becomes the result of calling
    `peekValue`.

    Likewise, the `__tojson` metamethod must be a function that
    returns a valid JSON string. The result in that case is the
    decoded string.

    If both, `__toaeson` and `__tojson` are set, then `__toaeson`
    takes precedent.

-   The test suite now has *tasty-hunit* as an additional
    dependency.

## hslua-aeson-2.2.1

Released 2022-06-23.

-   Export `jsonarray`, which is the name of the registry slot
    holding the metatable given to array tables. Setting the
    corresponding registry value will affect all newly created
    array values.

## hslua-aeson-2.2.0.1

Released 2022-06-16.

-   Relaxed upper bound for mtl, allowing mtl-2.3.

-   Relaxed upper bound for aeson, allowing aeson-2.1.

## hslua-aeson-2.2.0

Released 2022-02-19.

-   Relaxed upper bound for hslua-core and hslua-marshalling,
    allowing version 2.2 of both packages.

## hslua-aeson-2.1.0

Released 2022-01-29.

-   Update to hslua 2.1.

-   Encode `null` as light userdata: The `NULL` pointer wrapped
    into a light userdata is used to encode the JSON null value.

    The `pushNull` function has been removed; use
    `pushValue Null` instead.

-   Types that are instances of `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` can be
    marshalled/unmarshalled by using the new functions
    `pushViaJSON` and `peekViaJSON`, respectively.

-   The functions `peekVector`, `pushVector`, `peekScientific`,
    `pushScientific`, `peekKeyMap`, and `pushKeyMap` are
    considered an implementation detail and are no longer
    exported.

-   Array elements are now marked with a metatable. This avoids
    the need for an extra `0` element in the table and offers
    flexibility for users who want to give special behavior to
    lists. The newly exported value `jsonarray` contains the name
    of the registry slot under which the metatable is stored. The
    table can be modified or replaced as required.

## hslua-aeson-2.0.1

Released 2021-12-28.

-   Restored compatibility with aeson 1.5.

## hslua-aeson-2.0.0

Released 2021-12-17.

-   Changed module name from `Foreign.Lua.Aeson` to
    `HsLua.Aeson`.

-   The Peekable and Pushable instances have been removed. The
    package no longer defines orphaned instances.

-   Updated hslua and aeson to the respective 2.0 version.

## hslua-aeson-1.0.3.1

Released 2020-10-16.

-   Allow hslua-1.3.\*.

## hslua-aeson-1.0.3

Released 2020-08-15.

-   Relaxed version constraint for hslua, allowing `hslua-1.2.*`.

## hslua-aeson-1.0.2

Released 2020-05-28

-   Relaxed version constraint for aeson, allowing `aeson-1.5.*`.

-   Update CI tests to check with GHC versions 8.0 through 8.10.
    Compilation with GHC 7.10 is no longer tested.

-   Bump to stackage LTS-14.

## hslua-aeson-1.0.1

Released 2020-04-03

-   Relax version constraint for packages hashable and hslua,
    allow `hashable-1.3` and `hslua-1.1.*`.

## hslua-aeson-1.0.0

Released 2019-09-24.

-   Update to hslua 1.0.0

-   Function `registerNull` has been replaced by `pushNull`.

    Using `pushNull` has the advantage that users wonâ€™t have to
    remember to register a special variable. Users who need a
    global variable can set it by running

          pushNull
          setglobal "HSLUA_AESON_NULL"
