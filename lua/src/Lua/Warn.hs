-- | Sets a warning function. This is a simplified version of
-- 'Lua.Primary.lua_setwarnf'. The function at the top of the stack is
-- set as the "warning hook", i.e., it is called with the concatenated
-- warning components as the single argument.
--
-- The hook function is popped of the stack.
--
-- The control messages @\@on@ and @\@off@ are still supported; as with
-- the default warning function, these commands can switch error
-- reporting to stderr on and off. The given Haskell function will be
-- called in either case, even when the error is not written to stderr.
